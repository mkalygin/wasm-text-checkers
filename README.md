# Wasm Text Checkers

Naive implementation of checkers with WebAssembly text format. With this implementation you can only move a piece by one square and make a piece crowned. Click on the current player's piece to get started. Feel free to implement full rules of the game. :â€“)

Based on [Programming WebAssembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust) book by Kevin Hoffman.
